## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required project dependencies using npm:

4. Create Environment File
You'll need to create a .env file to store your environment variables (like database credentials, API keys, etc.).

If you have a .env.example file, you can copy it:

Bash

cp .env.example .env
If not, just create a new file named .env in the root of the project.

5. Add Environment Variables
Open the .env file in your code editor and fill in the necessary values.

Example (.env):

Ini, TOML

# Server Configuration
PORT=8080

# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/your-db-name"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your_super_strong_secret_key"
‚ö° Running the Application
Once the installation is complete and your .env file is configured, you can start the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The server should now be running and listening for requests (e.g., at http://localhost:8080).
